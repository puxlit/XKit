    "# XKit Lightweight Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rough Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "  - motivation\n",
    "      - [#1432: Memory spike when directly visiting blogs](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/1432)\n",
    "  - cases\n",
    "      - no XKit; baseline\n",
    "      - XKit bootstrapped from a content script with a minimal static blacklist and eager loading of assets; effectively pre-[#1433](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/pull/1433)\n",
    "      - XKit bootstrapped from a content script with an aggressive static blacklist and eager loading of assets; post-[#1433](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/pull/1433)\n",
    "      - XKit bootstrapped from a content script (to a background script) with a dynamic whitelist and deferred loading of assets\n",
    "          - two sub-cases will mimic configurations equivalent to the aforementioned minimal and aggressive static blacklists\n",
    "          - pros\n",
    "              - XKit will load in the same set of circumstances as before (since we're still bootstrapping from a content script, with the same `matches` and `exclude_matches` rules defined in the manifest)\n",
    "              - we can marshal storage access via the background script (leaving stubs in `bridge.js`); this might work around [#1432](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/1432)\n",
    "              - there are probably other opportunities to share resources\n",
    "          - cons\n",
    "              - probably a slightly higher baseline memory usage\n",
    "              - slightly more latency due to the trampoline and whitelist testing\n",
    "      - XKit bootstrapped from a background script with a dynamic whitelist and deferred loading of assets\n",
    "          - pros\n",
    "              - we can intercept `/xkit_(editor|log|reset|update)` requests earlier, which'd permit us to do fancy things down the track (like handle an OAuth callback)\n",
    "              - we can heuristically inspect and inject ourselves into blogs with custom domains (since we already have the `*://*/*` permission)\n",
    "          - cons\n",
    "              - we might need more permissions (like `webRequest`)\n",
    "  - measurements\n",
    "      - page timings\n",
    "      - Chrome DevTools Performance\n",
    "          - JS memory usage peak\n",
    "          - total XKit-related JS execution duration\n",
    "      - perhaps Chrome CPU/memory usage (via collectd)\n",
    "  - targets\n",
    "      - [yet-another-xkit-dev](https://yet-another-xkit-dev.tumblr.com/)  \n",
    "        ![Screenshot of yet-another-xkit-dev.tumblr.com](blog.png)\n",
    "          - 15 posts, 32 iframes (15 like, 5 photoset, 5 video, 5 audio, 1 controls, 1 analytics)\n",
    "          - test as anonymous user\n",
    "          - test with both cold and warm caches (as network requests for such a media-heavy page might mask the cost of running the extension)\n",
    "      - probably not the dashboard, since we're primarily interested in exercising the iframe-heavy blog page use case\n",
    "  - considerations\n",
    "      - GC\n",
    "      - variable VM and network performance\n",
    "      - gotta nix update checks\n",
    "      - whether any hypothetical performance improvements can justify a change in WebExtension permissions\n",
    "      - perhaps we should also test with authenticated users and more representative XKit extension loadouts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "  - most of Tumblr (dashboard, settings, search, etc.): `https://www.tumblr.com/*`\n",
    "      - frames (that don't matter):\n",
    "          - `https://cookiex.ngd.yahoo.com/*` (always?)\n",
    "          - `https://safe.txmblr.com/*` (for authenticated views?)\n",
    "          - `https://www.tumblr.com/hsts` (sometimes?)\n",
    "  - blogs: `*://*.tumblr.com/*` or `*://*/*` (for those with custom domains)\n",
    "      - frames:\n",
    "          - blog controls: `https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/iframe` or `about:blank` (for unauthenticated users)\n",
    "          - like control: `*://assets.tumblr.com/assets/html/like_iframe.html`\n",
    "          - audio: `*://*/post/[post_id]/audio_player_iframe/[username]/*`\n",

    "      - frames (that don't matter):\n",
    "          - `https://assets.tumblr.com/analytics.html`\n",
    "  - other pages that contain Tumblr embeds: `*://*/*`\n",
    "      - frames:\n",
    "          - embed: `https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/*`"
